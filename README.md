# Discord-Plex-Announce-Script
 - Script to scan directory for files and announces new files to discord channel.
 - Logs files to .txt file so the script won't double announce a file.

## Work in progress.  
- Should work as is but needs more goodies.

##TODO
1.  Add TMDb api to pull movie poster and info.
2.  Clean up movie and tv show file name before announcing in channel (won't edit file name on server).
3.  Write bash script to run php file every X amount of seconds.
4.  Option to announce in different channels based on file.
5.  Might make a flat file base system to save TMDb info.
6.  I'm sure I will think of more.
